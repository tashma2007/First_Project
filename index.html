            <p class="lead">So, you've went through pages of possiblities on some dating app and found a match, or maybe
                you've finally got that cute co-worker on the second floor to notice you. You've connected a few times
                over the phone and when you finally ask him or her out on a date, that special someone accepts. You're
                on cloud nine, right?! Until...the questions is asked, "What do you want to do for our first date?" Your
                mind shuts down. <i>Houston, we have a problem!</i> But wait! You just remembered
                that you have us. We'll provide you with upcoming events and restaurants in the Charlotte area, and
                dating ideas that you can use even if you're on a budget. We've even thrown in the weather so you and
                your date won't be hiking in the rain!</p>
